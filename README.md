# TechnoTuts Ver 1.0

Topics covered are:
1. Login screen with credentials provided by the user. Register first, then use the provided credentials to log in.
2. You can view the author details in the about section.
3. Dashboard page - there is a menu on the left hand side and a sliding menu that comes up on clicking the 'bars' icon on the top left corner. On the static left menu, only 'Checkboxes/Radio' and 'Product List' items work. Rest are in work in progress state.
4. The user can modify the logged in credentials and the same will be reflected on the top right corner of the page.
5. Please note that the page is not made responsive, only CSS3 Flexbox has been used, so trying to open it in smaller screens may hamper the experience.
